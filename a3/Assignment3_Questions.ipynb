    "A learning algorithm (otherwise called a model) attempts to take some input and map it to some output. Now you might call this a function, and you would be correct, but a learning algorithm is merely a function approximator. Not all input/output combinations have underlying functions, some things in life are just random. Therefore, we try to build a function approximator that tries to minimize the error for this mapping. Thus given some input output pairs, we build a function approximator, that learns the function by minimizing the error between its predictions and the ground truth."

    "- Supervised Learning: Supervised Learning is the classic function approximator learning algorithm. We get inputs and outputs and we need to find a function that minimizes the error. The biological plausibility or supervised learning is not very strong since labeled data isn't something that's often seen in real life. However, one might make the argument that reflexes such as actions taken when you get a sensory input are a result of your brain using a model that is akin to supervised learning.\n",
    "- Unsupervised Learning: For unsupervised learning, the model is not given any labels which you would imagine to be more similar to how real life works. Instead, the model exploits the underlying structure in the data to learn patterns. This is more biologically plausible (similar items are grouped together in the brain).\n",
    "- Reinforcement Learning: Given a reward function and some start point, RL aims to maximize the reward in its environment by taking actions. This is also biologically plausible since the world and society in general has a set of unspoken reward functions which condition our behavior.\n",
    "- Hebbian Learning: Hebbian learning is a type of unsupervised learning that is biologically plausible. It states that neurons that fire together wire together. This is a very simple learning rule that is often used in the brain to learn patterns. However, it is not very good at learning complex patterns."
